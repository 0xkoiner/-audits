# Public Portfolio
Hi, I’m 0xKoiner—a security researcher and auditor passionate about helping Web3 projects build safer and more reliable systems. I specialize in providing detailed reviews and security-focused insights to strengthen the blockchain ecosystem.

With experience across the blockchain stack—from protocol design to smart contracts and even the Solidity compiler—I’m here to help your project navigate the complexities of security with care and precision.

Let’s work together to make Web3 a stronger and safer space, one secure contract at a time.

# About OxKoiner

Hi, I’m OxKoiner, a developer and smart contract auditor based in sunny Barcelona. My journey in the crypto industry started back in 2016, and it’s been an exciting ride ever since. With a background in Computer Science from the Technion (Israel Institute of Technology), I’ve built up a versatile skill set that spans Python development and smart contract security.

My Experience
Python Development
I have a solid background in Python, focusing on backend development, software automation, testing, and Web3 libraries. I enjoy building tools and solutions that help simplify complex problems, and I’m always looking for new ways to streamline workflows and processes.

Solidity & Smart Contract Development
I’m a junior Solidity developer with a growing passion for low-level aspects of Ethereum development, including OpCodes, Huff, and Assembly. I love diving into the details of smart contract design, aiming to write clean, efficient, and secure code. I’m still learning every day, but I enjoy the challenge of constantly improving.

Auditing & Security
I’ve completed several courses focused on smart contract audits and enjoy the process of analyzing code for potential vulnerabilities. My toolkit includes:

Foundry & HardHat: For testing and development.
Slither & Aderyn: For static analysis and finding common issues.
Certora: For formal verification to ensure contract safety.
I take a careful, methodical approach when auditing, trying to catch even the smallest issues that could become big problems. I believe every audit is a chance to learn and help make the Web3 space a bit safer.

My Approach
I’m motivated by a genuine interest in blockchain technology and its potential to bring about positive change. I’m not an expert in everything, but I’m always eager to learn and collaborate with others. If you’re working on an interesting project or need a fresh set of eyes for an audit, I’d love to connect and see how I can help.

Let’s build something great together!
